# Info

Cursr is a cross-platform utility application for optimizing mouse movements between displays and multiple devices by creating custom links/portals between borders in a multiple display and device setups, but can also be useful to some with a single display setup. It was initially created to solve issue of related to using inputs like mouse across multiple displays, but now it also includes keyboard and clipboard sharing for multiple device users. Cursr was created because other existing solutions in the market did not work for me and there had to be more people that were also looking for better solution.

Cursr is created and developed by a single developer full-time without any funding, therefore purchase of Cursr not only gives you access to advanced (Pro) features, but it also greatly supports the project and makes it sustainable for the developer to keep working on it full-time, meaning you'll get updates with new features and any bugs/issues fixed.

Available on Windows, OSX and Linux*

<small style="opacity:0.5">* Linux tested on Ubuntu (Gnome and KDE), on other distributions or desktop environments it will default to Ubuntu Gnome behavior and will probably not work. If you would like to see support for other distribution or desktop environment please create Github issue. </small>

# Support

For support, feature requests and discussions you can
* [Open an issue](https://github.com/bitgapp/Cursr/issues/new/choose) in this repository
* Leave a message in [Cursr Discord](https://discord.gg/jzuXJxYaHW) server
* Send email to contact@cursr.app

# Features  

## Current

* Create links between borders to allow mouse to move between them to:
  * Move mouse proportionally between different resolution screens
  * Move mouse faster between displays that are further apart by creating a link between their borders, instead of moving mouse across all screens in between
* Split border into smaller segments allowing you to move from one border to 2 or more displays
* Save setups for different display layouts and let Cursr auto-select best matching setup when application starts or layout changes
* Customize the UI by
  * Changing colors of linked borders and border segments
* Software KVM - Connect multiple devices with Cursr to:
  * Share mouse, keyboard and clipboard between devices
  * Interchangeably use any connected mouse and keyboard on the go, no restricions for using only mouse/keyboard of 'main/server' device

# Roadmap - What's next?

> The Roadmap migh be affected by any exiting or new issues/bugs if they will occur.

<small style="opacity:0.5">Ordered without priority:</small>

* Bug fixes currently affecting users
* Feature to prevent mouse crossing a border when it's undesired, example when trying to move window to edge or click a button close to display edge
* Performance improvements
* More UI customization options
* Shortcuts to control cursor allowing you to create key bindings to move cursor to specific position on screen or completely control cursor/mouse with keyboard
* Setups usage optimizations
* Segments for blocking
* [cursr.app](cursr.app) site update
* Improving Cursr discoverability and potentially marketing
* System for sharing and voting for setups to help users find setup/layout ideas


### Other

> Currently there are about 150+ tasks in backlog for Cursr, ranging anywhere from 10min to 100h+ (for more complex new feature ideas that I'm not ready to publish yet) for estimated completion time. The list below contains just a few generic examples that are more likely to be implemented within a years time.

* Bug report form in App and in Website
* Make Cursr available on Mac App Store, Windows Store and Snap Store (Linux)
* Draw overlay/preview of borders, segments and links over the top of whole screens
* Cloud sync
* Allow changing display layout from withing the app instead of having to open display settings of the operating system
* Look into allowing to change/adjust cursor speed size on different resolution screens (seems to be mostly relevant to Linux users)
* Rewrite Cursr from Electron to Tauri and Rust, this should provide a good performance boost and reduce the package size of Cursr
